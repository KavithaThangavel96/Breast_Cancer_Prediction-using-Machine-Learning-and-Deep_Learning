# Breast Cancer Prediction System using machine learning and deep learning
>The aim of this project is to predict Breast cancer using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms.This project implements 4 classificiation models using scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier and Decision Tree Model to investigate their performance on Breast Cancer datasets obtained from the kaggle repository
>
# Getting Started

The project is broken down into the following steps:
<ol>
    <li>  Load and preprocess the image dataset</li>
    <li> Train the image classifier on your dataset </li>
    <li> Use the trained classifier to predict image content </li> </ol>
