# Breast Cancer Prediction System using machine learning and deep learning
A computer vision model to detect breast cancer in histopathological images. The two classes include:

- Benign
- and Malignant.
  
>The aim of this project is to predict Breast cancer using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms.This project implements 4 classificiation models using scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier and Decision Tree Model to investigate their performance on Breast Cancer datasets obtained from the kaggle repository

>The aim of this project is to develop and implement a deep learning model using TensorFlow to predict the likelihood of breast cancer in patients. By leveraging the power of neural networks and TensorFlow, the goal is to create an accurate, reliable, and efficient tool that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage, thereby improving treatment outcomes and patient survival rates.

# Getting Started

The project is broken down into the following steps:
<ol>
    <li>  Load and preprocess the image dataset</li>
    <li> Train the image classifier on your dataset </li>
    <li> Use the trained classifier to predict Benign or Malignant </li> </ol>

# Technologies Used:
- **Python:** The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language for data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.
- **Libraries:** Key Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Seaborn are employed for data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization.
- **Machine Learning:** Various machine learning algorithms are explored and compared to identify the most suitable model for predicting heart diseases.
- **Deep Learning:** Implement the model using TensorFlow, ensuring it is optimized for accuracy and efficiency.

Early detection of Cancer is crucial for timely medical intervention, and this project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can contribute to healthcare by providing a valuable tool for identifying individuals at risk. The "Breast cancer Prediction" project exemplifies the practical application of data science skills in solving real-world health challenges
